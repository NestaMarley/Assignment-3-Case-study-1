# When AI Sees Cheaters Everywhere: A Tale of Eye Movements and Neurodiversity

Imagine a world where an all-seeing AI is watching students during exams, ready to catch any sneaky glances at notes or phones. Sounds like a sci-fi movie, right? Well, welcome to the future! Our tech-savvy overlord uses eye movement tracking to flag potential cheaters. But hold on—there’s a twist in this plot. 

### What’s the AI Up To?

This AI monitors eye movements to determine if a student is “cheating.” It looks for patterns, like darting eyes or prolonged glances away from the test paper. While this might sound like a clever way to maintain academic integrity, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. 

The Trouble with Tech

Here’s where things go awry:

1. **Fairness**: The AI doesn’t know that some students, especially neurodivergent individuals, may naturally exhibit different eye movements. It’s a bit like using a hammer to fix a watch—great for hitting things, not so much for precision.

2. **Privacy**: Students aren’t just test-takers; they’re humans with rights! Tracking their eye movements can feel invasive, like having a nosy neighbor peeking over the fence while you’re trying to garden.

3. **Accountability**: What happens when the AI flags a student unfairly? Is there a human to review the decision, or is it just “guilty until proven innocent”? That sounds more like a dystopian novel than a fair academic process.

### A Responsible Improvement

So, how do we fix this mess without throwing the AI out with the bathwater? 

**Introduce a Neurodiversity-Friendly Calibration Phase**: Before the big test, let’s have a session where students can demonstrate their eye movements in a relaxed setting. This would help the AI learn what “normal” looks like for different students, including those who are neurodivergent. Think of it as teaching the AI to understand the quirks of human behavior rather than just relying on rigid rules.

In the end, while AI can be a powerful tool, it’s crucial to remember that it’s only as good as the data it learns from—and the humans guiding its development. Let’s make sure our future tech is as inclusive and fair as possible!
